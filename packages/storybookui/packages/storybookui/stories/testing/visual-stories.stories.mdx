## Visual Testing on Stories

Eventhough storybook supports many [tools](https://github.com/mojoaxel/awesome-regression-testing) for visual testing but it is recommand to use  [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) by maintainers to run visual tests.

> before you continues it is recommand to make a github repository for your storybook project. 
> And login in [here](https://www.chromatic.com/) with your github account and import your repository.

```bash
# With npm
npm install chromatic --save-dev

# With yarn
yarn add --dev chromatic

```
Run this to integrate with your project.

```bash
#  replace `your-project-token` with the one provided by Chromatic.
npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>
```

> If you are building your project with various toolings your build script can be vary .
> But you can specify with a flag in [Chromatic cli](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/cli).

```bash
 npx chromatic --project-token=<my-token> --build-script-name=<your-tools-buildscript>
```
